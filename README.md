A home security operations center (SOC) lab built on Proxmox VE and Wazuh SIEM, with an isolated Raspberry Pi honeypot. The goal is to practice log collection, threat detection, and incident investigation hands-on, and build a foundation for a follow-up cloud security lab in Microsoft Azure.

> **Status:** In progress. Proxmox host is installed and remotely accessible; SOC architecture and Wazuh deployment are next.

## Goals

- Build a virtualized lab environment from bare metal
- Segment the lab network so attack traffic stays isolated
- Deploy Wazuh SIEM and collect logs from Windows and Linux endpoints
- Simulate attacks against an internal honeypot and write detections for them
- Document every phase, including what broke and how it was fixed

## Architecture

**Phase 1: On-prem (this repo)**
- Proxmox VE hypervisor hosting the Wazuh server and endpoint VMs
- Raspberry Pi honeypot on an isolated network segment (internal only, not internet-facing)
- Controlled attack simulation from a separate segment, with alerts flowing into Wazuh
- Remote administration over Tailscale with key-only SSH, with no inbound ports exposed

**Phase 2: Cloud (future repo)**
- Internet-facing honeypot in Azure feeding Microsoft Sentinel for real-world attack analysis
_Network diagram coming once the layout is finalized._

## Hardware

| Component | Role |

## Lessons Learned

- Check release notes and known issues before installing; the newest version isn't always the most stable.
- When two independently verified pieces of media fail the same way, search the exact error text before re-diagnosing.
- Prove a replacement works (key login) from a fresh session before removing the fallback (password login).
- Real environments come with constraints, like campus network rules, and the lab has to be designed around them.
